# Photo-editor
I made a photo editor using python. One of my most impressive work since I'm still learning it.


How to run without any problem:

1. Clone the project

2. Using your terminal go into the same directory as the project

3. Type pip install requirement.txt

4. While in the directory of the porject in the terminal type "python photoeditor.py"
