# Photo-editor
I made a photo editor using python. One of my most impressive work since I'm still learning it.


How to run without any problem:

1. Download the project

2. Using your terminal go into the same directory as the project

3. Install Pillow (use "pip install Pillow" for windows, if you are not using windows go to "https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html" and find out)

4. While in the directory of the porject in the terminal type "python photoeditor.py"
